# fefw-recomp — unofficial source archive

This independent archive preserves the published source of **fefw-recomp** in case the upstream repository becomes unavailable. The original project was created by [Goldoire](https://github.com/Goldoire). Credit for the code belongs to Goldoire and the contributors named in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/Goldoire/fefw-recomp) and the [Credits](#credits) below.

This snapshot is based on upstream [v0.1.4](https://github.com/Goldoire/fefw-recomp/tree/v0.1.4), commit `45a1904ca81995bfea39cb7aa1012851d3aa84d8`. On 2026-11-09, this archive added the preservation and attribution notice, updated the documentation links, and added ignore rules for local packages.

The archive carries the upstream [GPL-3.0 license](LICENSE) and retains the third-party notices and licenses. Game dumps, firmware, decryption keys, files generated from game data, and prebuilt release downloads are outside the scope of this archive. See [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md).

## About the upstream project

A native Windows PC port of **Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave** (Nintendo Switch 2), made by static recompilation. The game's code is
translated to C++ and compiled into a regular Windows program, which runs on a small runtime that stands in for the console's system
software and draws with Vulkan. It is not an emulator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No game files are included or downloadable here.** This project contains only its own tools and runtime. To play, you need your
> own legally dumped copy of the game; everything that reads the game happens on your PC. See [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md).
>
> Not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo or Intelligent Systems.

## Features

- Runs natively on Windows, with no emulator in between
- 60 or 120 FPS modes, any output resolution, render scale and a temporal upscaler
- Windowed, borderless or fullscreen
- Keyboard and mouse or any controller, with matching button prompts
- An in-game settings overlay (**F1**)
- A launcher that sets everything up from your dump, with nothing else to install

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and an up-to-date driver
- 16 GB of RAM and about 30 GB of free disk space
- Your own decrypted dump of the game at update **131072**, in one of these forms:
  - a folder with `exefs\` and `romfs\`
  - a dump folder with `base\` and `updates\<version>\`
  - a [`.nup`](https://github.com/a55uka/nup) package

## Getting started

1. Download `fefw-recomp-<version>-win64.zip` from the [upstream Releases](https://github.com/Goldoire/fefw-recomp/releases) page and extract it to its own folder.
2. Run `fefw-launcher.exe`.
3. On **Setup**, choose your dump folder (or **.nup** file) and press **Set up**. The launcher checks your files, builds the game on
   your PC and prepares the shaders. The first setup takes a while; you can **Pause** it and continue later.
4. Press **Play**.

Your saves are in the `save\` folder next to the launcher.

### Settings

The launcher's **Settings** page covers resolution, frame rate, upscaling, window mode, sound and controls. Press **F1** in game for
the overlay. Every option is described in [runtime/docs/CONFIG.md](runtime/docs/CONFIG.md).

### Updating to a new release

Extract the new zip to a new folder, copy your `save\` folder into it, and run **Set up** again.

## Troubleshooting

- **"These game files are a different version"**: only update 131072 is supported. Check that you dumped the update, not only the
  base game.
- **Setup stopped or failed**: press **Set up** again to continue where it stopped. **Open full log** on the Setup page shows what
  went wrong.
- **The game closes or freezes**: look at `fefw.log` in the launcher's folder, and update your GPU driver.

## Reporting problems

Open an [upstream issue](https://github.com/Goldoire/fefw-recomp/issues) with `fefw.log`, your GPU, driver and Windows version, and the release you used. Please do not attach
game files or anything made from them.

## Building from source

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md). Submit contributions to the upstream project while it is available.
